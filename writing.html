                    A thousand things can feel like love.<br>
                    You can make my heart flutter and bring it calm.<br>
                    You're my beautiful beginning and painful end,<br>
                    My everything, my love, not my forever but my infinity.<br>
                    My happiness you give me, my loudest laughs.<br>
                    You're my cute dynamite, my powerhouse.<br>
                    My beautiful dream on cloud seven.<br>
                    You're my safe reality, my peace and calm.<br>
                    You're my only 'please don't sleep' good night.<br>
                    To have the best day, but I want you with me, good morning.<br>
                    I tell you See you later, but really be wanting to see you again and hug you again, kiss you again.<br>
                    You’ve changed meanings and brought intentions to phrases.<br>
                    You’ve altered my language and meanings to rather pure intentions I hide within myself.<br>
                    I love you forever if it's the longest time sequence.<br>
                    I love you for everything.<br>
                    I love you for being mine.<br>
